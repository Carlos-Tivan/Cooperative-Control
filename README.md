# Cooperative-Control

## Overview

Robotics has become a key technology in various industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. The field of cooperative robotics is particularly promising, as it involves multiple robots working together to complete complex tasks, enhancing both productivity and work quality.

## Description

Cooperative robotics involves two or more robots working in tandem to perform tasks that are complex or challenging for individual robots. These robots can be autonomous, semi-autonomous, or remotely controlled and are equipped with sensors and vision systems to work in a coordinated manner. A common application of cooperative robotics is object transportation, where robots collaborate to move large and heavy objects efficiently and safely.

This project focuses on using MATLAB simulation to design and validate cooperative robotic systems. MATLAB provides a robust environment for testing systems in various scenarios, adjusting parameters, and identifying potential issues before physical deployment.

## Features

- Simulation of cooperative robotic systems in MATLAB
- Testing of different scenarios and system parameters
- Route planning and action coordination for object transportation
- Detection and debugging of errors before physical implementation

## Installation

To set up the project, ensure you have MATLAB installed. Then, follow these steps:
