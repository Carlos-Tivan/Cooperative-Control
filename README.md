# Cooperative-Control
Robotics has been one of the most prominent areas in the last decade, with applications in various industries such manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. 
Robots have become an essential tool to enhance productivity and efficiency in industry. Cooperative robotics is a promising solution for complex and challenging tasks. 
In cooperative robotics, two or more robots work together to perform a task, with the goal of improving efficiency and the quality of the work performed. These robots can be autonomous, 
semi-autonomous, or remotely controlled, and can be equipped with sensors and vision systems to detect the environment and work in a coordinated manner. Object transportation is one of the most common applications in cooperative robotics, 
as it requires robots to work together to safely and efficiently move large and heavy objects from one place to another. In this task, route planning and action coordination are essential to achieve precise and smooth execution. 
In this context, simulation in MATLAB has become a powerful tool for the design and validation of cooperative robotic systems, as it allows testing the system in different scene, adjusting its parameters, and detecting errors before physical implementation. 
Therefore, the combination of cooperative robotics and simulation in MATLAB is an attractive option to enhance efficiency in industry and effectively solve complex tasks.
